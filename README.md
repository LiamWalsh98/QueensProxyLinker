# Queen's University Proxy Linker

by Liam Walsh

[Queen's University proxy service login](https://login.proxy.queensu.ca/public/proxystart.html)

[Allowed off-campus URL list](https://login.proxy.queensu.ca/public/menu-queens.html)

This plugin will add a button that opens the current URL using the Queen's off-campus proxy. The plugin will redirect to Queen's single sign-on and does not interact with the login in any way.
